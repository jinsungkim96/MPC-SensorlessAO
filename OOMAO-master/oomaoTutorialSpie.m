%% INTRODUCTION

% Object--Oriented \matlab Adaptive Optics (\oomao) is a library of \matlab
% classes. Objects from the different classes are assembled to perform the
% numerical modeling of Adaptive Optics systems. \oomao can be seen as an
% extension of the \matlab language. Overloaded \matlab operators are used
% to propagate the wavefront through the system and to update object
% properties.
% \newline
% A class is a container for a set of parameters and functions. In the
% \matlab nomenclature, the parameters and the functions of a class are
% called the properties and the methods, respectively. An object is created
% (or instantiated) from a class by calling the class constructor method.
% The proper syntax of the constructor can be discovered by invoking
% \matcall{help class\_name} at the \matlab prompt. A more complete
% description of a class properties and methods is given by \matcall{doc
% class\_name}.
% \newline
% The constructor method will set only a limited number of properties,
% other properties will be set to a default value. All the properties can
% be altered afterwards anyway. A property is read or set through
% object\_name.property\_name.
% \newline
% The main classes used during a simulation are \begin{itemize} \item
% \oo{source}, \item \oo{atmosphere}, \item \oo{telescope}, \item
% \oo{shackHartmann}, \item \oo{deformableMirror}. \end{itemize}
% Fig.~\ref{fig:oomaoClassTree} shows the relations between the main
% classes of \oomao. 
% The classes are setup along an optical path for a closed--loop AO system.
% The operators used to optically link the classes are superimposed to the
% optical link.
% Classes are documentes following \matlab documentation
% standard and can be extracted with the \matcall{doc} command. The
% classes description generated with \matcall{doc} is the library reference
% documentation.
% \newline
% In addition to the classes to model AO systems, \oomao has a rich library
% of functions to compute various statistical properties of the wavefront.
% These functions are contained within the \oo{phaseStats} and
% \oo{zernikeStats} classes and the list of their methods are given in
% Fig.~\ref{fig:oomaoPerfClasses}.
% The figure of merit of an AO system is often the image of a point--like
% star after correction.  
% The PSF is collected with the \oo{imager} class
% (Fig.~\ref{fig:oomaoClassTree}) which properties \oop{imager}{frame},
% \oop{imager}{strehl} and \oop{imager}{ee} correspond to the star image
% and the Strehl ratio and the ensquared energy of the
% point--spread--function, respectively.

% \oomao relies on sparse matrices where possible, in order to
% minimize the computer memory load, and used \matlab transparent parallel loop for
% the heftiest computation.
% Parallel for loops require the \emph{Parallel Computing
% Toolbox}$^{\textrm{\scriptsize \textregistered}}$.
% \newline
% \oomao is used by several projects.
% For example, the control software of RAVEN~\cite{AJB+12} is based on \oomao and \oomao
% was used during the conceptual and preliminary design phases of the GMT
% LTAO system~\cite{CEP+13} to compare different design options.

% \section{Setting-up an OOMAO simulation}
% In this section, we describe the different steps to model an AO system.
% \oomao does not have configuration files like many other AO simulation software \cite{RV13,CVF+05}.
% An \oomao simulation is build in the same way an AO optical bench is build.
% The main steps in the construction and deployment of an AO system are
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item selection of the components
% \item initialization of the components
% \item calibration of the components
% \item link the components with a control system
% \end{enumerate}
% </latex>

% \subsection{Component selection}

% <latex>
% \subsubsection{The source}
% The \oo{source} class has a very important role in the \oomao library as it is the link between other classes.
% A \oo{source} object carries a wavefront, both amplitude and phase, through different objects representing the atmosphere, the telescope, the \wfs, ...
% Both \ngs and \lgs \ao can be simulated.
% For a NGS, the source height is infinite.
% For a LGS, the source height is finite and can be set to a vector of
% heights depending on the thickness of the source.
% A simple on--axis \ngs object is created by calling the \oo{source} constructor without parameters:
% </latex>
ngs =source;
%%
% <latex>
% The first time a object from an \oomao class is created a message let the user aware he is using the library.
% A summary of the object main parameters is also displayed.
% In this example, zenith and azimuth angle are both set to zero, the star height is infinite, the wavelength is 550nm and the magnitude is set to 0.
% </latex>
%%
% <latex>
% \subsubsection{The atmosphere}
% Next, we create the atmosphere the source will propagate through.
% The \oo{atmosphere} class contains all the parameters defining the atmosphere including the turbulence profile.
% A 3--layer atmosphere with a 20cm Fried parameter in the
% visible and a 30m outer scale is created with:
% </latex>
atm = atmosphere(photometry.V,20e-2,30,...
    'fractionnalR0',[0.5,0.3,0.2],'altitude',[0e3,5e3,12e3],...
    'windSpeed',[10,5,20],'windDirection',[0,pi/2,pi]);
%%
% <latex>
% The \oo{photometry} class contains the definition of the photometric
% systems.
% If an altered photometric system is needed, modification must be done
% into the class itself.
% </latex>
%%
% <latex>
% \subsubsection{The telescope}
% Lest first make the NGSAO model scalable by defining the number of
% lenslet \texttt{nL} of the wavefront sensor, the number of pixel per lenslet \texttt{nPx}, the
% telescope diameter \texttt{D} in meter and the sampling frequency \texttt{samplingFreq} in
% Hz.
% </latex>
nL   = 60;
nPx  = 10;
nRes = nL*nPx;
D    = 25;
d    = D/nL; % lenslet pitch
samplingFreq = 500;
%%
% <latex>
% Now, we create a telescope of diameter \texttt{D} with a pupil sampled with \texttt{nRes} pixel.
% The telescope field--of--view is 30arcsec and the temporal evolution of
% wavefront in the telescope pupil will be sampled at \texttt{samplingFreq}.
% </latex>
tel = telescope(D,'resolution',nRes,...
    'fieldOfViewInArcsec',30,'samplingTime',1/samplingFreq);
%%
% <latex>
% \subsubsection{The wavefront sensor}
% To be complete an \aos needs a wavefront sensor (WFS). \oomao uses the
% Shack--Hartmann \wfs. A Shack--Hartmann \wfs is made of a lenslet array
% and a detector. The numerical model follows the physical model by
% embedding a lenslet array (\oo{lensletArray}) class and a detector
% (\oo{detector}) class in the \oo{shackHartmann} class. The
% \oo{lensletArray} class perform the numerical Fraunhoffer propagation of
% the wavefront to the detector. The \oo{detector} class implements a CCD
% camera detection process including Poisson and read--out noise. The
% lenslet images are Nyquist sampled per default.
% \newline
% A \oo{shackHartmann} object with a $\texttt{nL}\times \texttt{nL}$
% lenslet array and a $\texttt{nRes}\times \texttt{nRes}$ resolution camera
% is created.
% The \oop{lensletArray}{minLightRatio} property of the \oo{lensletArray}
% object set the minimum ratio of light intensity between a partially and
% fully illuminated lenslet.
% In the following, \oop{lensletArray}{minLightRatio} is set to 85\%:
% </latex>
wfs = shackHartmann(nL,nRes,0.85);
%%
% <latex>
% \paragraph{Wavefront sensor initialization}
% The next component to define is a deformable mirror (DM).
% The WFS and the DM are optically conjugated to the telescope pupil and
% the DM actuators are aligned to the WFS lenslet array following the Fried
% geometry i.e. they are located at the lenslet corners.
% To fully define the DM, one needs to initialized the WFS first by
% computing the "valid lenslet" which are the lenslet receiving sufficient
% light according to the value of \oop{lensletArray}{minLightRatio}.
% The propagation of the wavefront is performed with the overloaded \matlab
% operators \matcall{times} or \matcall{.*} and \matcall{mtimes} or
% \matcall{*}.
% </latex>
ngs = ngs.*tel*wfs;
%%
% <latex>
% The \oo{ngs} is propagated through the telescope, the WFS lenslet array and imagelets are formed on the WFS camera.
% Each time a call to \oom{source}{.*} is done the amplitude and phase
% values are reset to they default value 1 and 0, respectively and then
% \oom{source}{*} is called. When \oom{source}{*} is called the amplitude
% is multiplied by the amplitude of the right hand side object and the
% phase of the right hand side object is added to the phase of the
% \oo{source} object. \newline The \oom{source}{*} method is calling the
% \matcall{relay} method of the right hand side object. Most of the \oomao
% classes have a \matcall{relay} method allowing them to be used with the
% \oom{source}{.*} and  \oom{source}{*} operators of the class \oo{source}.
% </latex>
%%

% A warning is issued because the lenslets at the corner of the array are in the dark. 
% This issue is solved by selecting the lenslets that are receiving enough light to be useful to the wavefront detection.

% When the WFS detector is read again and a new processing of the frame is done, there is no more warning as only the

% \subsubsection{The deformable mirror}
% In a closed--loop \aos, the \dm is the first active component encounter by the wavefront.
% A numerical \dm is made of a set of influence functions or modes.
% In \oomao, a mode shape is derived from two cubic B\'ezier curves
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   \label{eq:2}
%   B_1(t) &=& (1-t^3)P_0+3(1-t)^2tP_1+3(1-t)t^2P2+t^3P_3,t \in [0,1]\\
%   B_2(t) &=& (1-t^3)P_3+3(1-t)^2tP_4+3(1-t)t^2P5+t^3P_6,t \in [0,1]
% \end{eqnarray}
% $P_k=(x_k,z_k)$ are point in the $x-z$ plane.
% As $t$ varies from 0 to 1, $B_1(t)$ will go from $P_0$ to $P_3$ and $B_2(t)$ will go from $P_3$ to $P_6$.
% $P_0$ will correspond to the highest point of the mode and is set to the coordinates $(x_0=0,z_0=1)$.
% The derivative of the mode at $P_0$ must be zero, this is ensure by setting $z_1=0$.
% The mode is forced to zero at $P_6$ by setting $z_6=0$.
% $x_6$ is set to 2.
% The derivative of the mode in $P_6$ is forced to zero by setting $z_5=0$.
% To ensure a smooth junction between both B\'ezier curves, the following condition is imposed $\vec{P_3P_2}=-\alpha \vec P_3P_4$ leading to $P_4=-P2/\alpha + (1+1/\alpha)P_3$.
% \newline
% From the conditions stated above, a \dm mode is set with the following parameters: $x_1$, $(x_2,z_2)$, $(x_3,z_3)$, $\alpha$ and $x_5$.
% \newline
% The 1--D half plane mode is obtained by concatenated both B\'ezier curves $$B(t)=\left[B_1(t) , B_2(t) \right].$$
% $B(t)$ is a vector of $x-z$ coordinates, $B(t)=\left(B_x(t) , B_z(t) \right)$.
% $B_x(t)$ is normalized by $B_x(t_c)$; $B_x(t_c)$ is the $x$ coordinate where $B_z(t)=c$, $c$ is the mechanical coupling of the \dm actuators. 
% The full 1--D mode $M(t)$ is made by concatenating $B(t)$ and is symmetric with respect to the $z$ axis, i.e. $$M_x(t)=\left(\left[B_{-x}(t) , B_x(t) \right] , \left[B_{z}(t) , B_z(t) \right] \right).$$
% The 2--D mode is the product of the 1-D modes in the $x-z$ plane and in the $y-z$ plane, $$M(t) = M_x(t)M_y(t).$$
% \newline
% An influence function is created with two arguments passed to its constructor: the list of $P_k$ coordinates in a cell and the mechanical coupling value.
% Instead of the list of parameters, the keywords \emph{'monotonic'} (${0.2,[0.4,0.7],[0.6,0.4],1,1}$) and \emph{'overshoot'} ($\{0.2,[0.4,0.7],[0.5,0.4],0.3,1\}$) can be used to call predefined parameter lists, as shown in the next examples:

% Lets switch off the display automatic update:

%%
% <latex>
% and setup the optical path before the DM/WFS subsystem:
% </latex>
ngs = ngs.*tel;
%%
% <latex>
% The interaction matrix is generated by pushing all the valid actuators
% sequentially and saving the corresponding WFS measurements in a matrix.
% The process is done with the \oom{deformableMirror}{calibration} method
% of the \oo{deformableMirror} class.
% The arguments of the method are the deformable mirror, the wavefront
% sensor, the calibration source and the actuator amplitude in meter.
% In \oomao, the generation of the interaction matrix is vectorized meaning
% it can be done in 1 step at the expense of requiring a lot of memory.
% Here the process is divided in as many steps as actuators accross the pupil.
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
% At the end of the calibration process, the interaction matrix is saved
% into the object \matcall{calibDm} of the class \oo{calibrationVault}.
% The interaction matrix is saved into the property
% \oop{calibrationVault}{D}.
% The singular value decomposition of \oop{calibrationVault}{D} is immediately computed and the
% pseudo--inverse of \oop{calibrationVault}{D} is saved into the property \oop{calibrationVault}{M}.
% A display window shows on the left the interaction matrix \oop{calibrationVault}{D} on the top
% right the eigen values of \oop{calibrationVault}{D} and in the bottom
% right the eigen modes corresponding to the eigen values given by the red line in the plot above, which here
% is essentially the piston mode.
% The truncated pseudo--inverse of \oop{calibrationVault}{D} is obtained by
% eliminating the lowest eigen values.
% The filtering of the lowest eigen values is obtained by changing the
% value of one of these properties: \oop{calibrationVault}{threshold}
% setting the minimum eigen values for the computing of \oop{calibrationVault}{M}, 
% \oop{calibrationVault}{nThresholded} setting the number of discarded eigen value starting from the lowest one
% or \oop{calibrationVault}{cond} forcing the condition number of
% \oop{calibrationVault}{D}.

% \section{Wavefront estimation}
% In \oomao, a wavefront can be described in a modal or zonal basis.
% In this basis, the wavefront can be reconstructed using either a
% Least-Square reconstructor (LSR) or a Minimum--Mean--Square--Error
% reconstructor (MMSE).
% In the following, several wavefront reconstruction methods are compared.
% \newline
% First lets bound the atmosphere to the telescope,
% without binding the \oo{atmosphere} object to a \oo{telescope} object, phase
% screens cannot be generated.
% Then the phase screens are displayed and the \matcall{ngs} optical path is
% setup. 
% A \oo{source} object saves its optical path into the
% \oop{source}{opticalPath} property allowing the \oo{source} to be
% propagated again with a simple call to the \oom{source}{uplus} or
% \oom{source}{+} operator.

% \section{Closed--loop NGS AO systems}
% \oomao can simulate AO systems in closed--loop, open--loop and in
% pseudo--open loop.
% A LQG temporal controller~\cite{CJV+14} for \oomao is currently in development.
% In this section, a closed--loop NGS AO is modeled.
% Lets first create a on--axis science celestial object in J band.
% Then, the science imaging camera is created with the class \oo{imager}.
% </latex>
science = source('wavelength',photometry.J);
cam = imager();
%%
% <latex>
% The \oo{atmosphere} object is detached from the telescope and the
% science star is propagated through the telescope to the science camera
% producing a perfect diffraction limited image.
% The camera display can also be set to update itself when a new camera frame
% is generated.
% </latex>

science = science.*tel*cam;

% The diffraction limited image is set as the reference frame allowing to
% compute the image Strehl ratio on the subsequent frame captures.
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
% The atmosphere is re--attached to the telescope, the science star is
% propagated again, this time first through the atmosphere and the
% atmosphere limited Strehl is obtained.
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
% Two types of controller are compared: a closed--loop LSR and a
% pseudo--open loop LMMSE.
% The two controllers can be tested side--by--side by using an unique
% feature of \oomao: the fact that some classes like \oo{shackHartmann} or
% \oo{deformableMirror} can duplicate some of their properties when they
% are faced with multiple sources.
% This means that if one needs to analyze the wavefront of several sources
% with the same Shack--Hartmann wavefront sensor, a single
% \oo{shackHartmann} object is only needed.
% \newline
% Two NGSs and two science objects are created and their optical paths set.
% Both are going through the atmosphere, the telescope and the DM, but the
% NGSs end up on the WFS and the science stars are both imaged with the
% science detector.
% The WFS display now shows the imagelets and slopes corresponding to the
% wavefronts of both NGSs.

% \section{Conclusion}
% \oomao is a versatile \matlab toolbox for the simulations of adaptive
% optics systems.
% With \oomao, AO systems are modeled using an object--oriented approach
% where there is a class for each AO component.
% The components can then be chained to each other to form the system optical
% path.
% Properties inside the classes allow to either get wavefront information
% or to shape it.
% The simple framework of \oomao makes it a versatile simulation tool
% capable of simulating many different systems from eXtreme-AO to LTAO on
% ELTS.
% \oomao is a mature software backed up by several years of development and
% it is now used by several projects.
