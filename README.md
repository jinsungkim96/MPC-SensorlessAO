# MPC-SensorlessAO
This is a `Matlab` implementation of the Model Predictive Control of Time-varying Aberrations for Sensorless Adaptive Optics from Jinsung~Kim et al. [[1]], designed for Sensorless adaptive optics. It maintains estimates of the moments of the gradient independently for each parameter.

##  Generating Time-varying Phase aberration
The time-varying phase aberration caused by atmospheric turbulence is generated by **Object-Oriented MATLAB & Adaptive Optics (OOMAO) Toolbox** [[2]].
The OOMAO sources are hosted by GitHub (https://github.com/rconan/OOMAO).
To illustrate a complex environment such as the real-world atmosphere, we designed a *mainly frozen-flow model* with three layers at diferent heights, wind speeds, and directions [[3]].

```matlab
clear;clc;close all;
addpath(genpath('D:\Users\Her\Documents\MATLAB\AO\4F-Optical-Correlator-Simulation-kim\OOMAO-master'))

samplingFreq = 200; % turbulence sampling frequency
nSimSteps = 2000;
T_final = nSimSteps;
nPolynomials = 28; % number of zernike modes (radial number = 6)

D = 1; % telescope diameter [m]
r0 = 0.2; % Fried parameter [m] % The strength of atmospheric turbulence (D/r0) is set as 5.
L0 = 42; % outer scale [m]

% mainly frozen-flow model
h = [1000, 5000, 12000]; % height [m]
v0 = [5, 7.5, 10]; % wind speed [m/s]
vD = [0, pi/3, 5*pi/3];

f_r0 = [0.7, 0.1, 0.2]./25; % Fractional r0

atm = atmosphere(photometry.V,r0,L0,'fractionnalR0',f_r0,'altitude',h,'windSpeed',v0,'windDirection',vD); % atmosphere

% telescope setting
nL = 512; % number of lenslet
nPx = 1; % number or pixel per lenslet
nRes = nL*nPx; % resolution
xaxis = 1:nRes;
d = D/nL; % lenslet pitch

tel = telescope(D,'resolution',nRes,'fieldOfViewInArcsec',2.5,'samplingTime',1/samplingFreq); % telescope
tel = tel + atm;

% Photometric system
% Band ( wavelength , bandwidth , zero point )
% V  ( 0.550e-6 , 0.090e-6 , 3.3e12 )
ngs = source('wavelength',photometry.V); % natural guide star
ngs = ngs.*tel;

sprintf('Calculating wavefront for %d steps ...',nSimSteps);

phase = []; time_phase = [];
for iSimStep=1:nSimSteps
    tic;
    +ngs;
    +tel;
    phase(:,:,iSimStep) = ngs.meanRmPhase; % time-varying phase aberrations (mainly frozen-flow model)
    time_phase(iSimStep) = ngs.timeStamp;
    zern2 = zern.\(ngs.meanRmPhase); % zernike coefficient generation
    toc;
end
```
##  Model Identification based on Time-series method
To determine the VAR model, any system identification method such as time-series, machine learning, and extrapolation can be used.
In this study, we designed an AR model based on a time-series method.
An open-loop wavefront dataset ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}%20\{x_t[k]|k=1,\cdots,t_{\textrm{train}}%20\}) was used to identify the model parameters ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20A_i):
```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
```


```matlab

```



##  Model Predictive Control Simulation
```matlab
% The strength of atmospheric turbulence (D/r0) is magnified by 10, 15, 20.
mag_conv_5 = 1;
mag_conv_10 = 1.781797436291855;
mag_conv_15 = 2.498049532979032;
mag_conv_20 = 3.174802103932926;

phase = phase .* mag_conv_10;
ad_acc = ad_acc .* mag_conv_10;
```
